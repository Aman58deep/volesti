Main development by Vissarion Fisikopoulos, University of Athens, Greece.
Main algorithm based on: I.Z. Emiris and V. Fisikopoulos, "Efficient random-walk methods for approximating polytope volume", In Proc. ACM Symposium on Computational Geometry 2014, pages 318-325.

We develop the R version of Volesti
