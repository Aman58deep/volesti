\title{Run some volume approximation experiments for V-polytopes.}
\usage{
VdemoVolume(algo)
}
\arguments{
\item{CG}{The string "CG" to choose CoolingGaussian algorithm.}

\item{SOB}{The string "SOB" to choose SequenceOfBalls algorithm.}
}
\value{
Print the computed volumes and the error. If the test fails a message is printed.
}
\description{
Choose between SequenceOfBalls and CoolingGaussian algorithm to approximate the volume of some cubes, simplices and cross polytopes in V-representation.
For each polytope we run \eqn{10} volume experiments and we consider the mean value as the volume approximation. For SOB algorithm we demand \eqn{error = 0.1} and for CG algorithm we demand \eqn{error = 0.2}.
